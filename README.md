#The Matterjs Challenge
##1.What library?  
**This example demonstrates the capability of [matterjs](http://brm.io/matter-js/),  a 2D physics engine for the web,**

##2.Why Matterjs?
**When developing web games, web programmers may need to simulate the real world physics environment(or change it). Instead of hard coding physical principles into their codes, using library is a wiser choice. And matterjs is such a powerful library. Compared with another physical engine, physics.js. Matter.js is easier to use.**

##3.Limitation
**The limitation of matterjs is that it's still under development. It is sometimes unstable in the game and bugs can happen. Also, I personally found it unable to draw more detailed figures. For example, making a human figure is hard in matter.js. Right now, it only has rectangle, circle,  polygon and trapezoid.**

##4.My example
**I designed a little game by using matterjs's gravity, expulsion, bullet time, mouse drag and figure drawing functoins. User moves the box on the left building to the string on the right building. Every time the user wins, he/she will go to next level, where there will be more circles moving around. The best level record the user has will be shown on the screen, with the current level.**

##5.How to run
**To run my example locally, users should download [matterjs](https://github.com/liabru/matter-js/releases/download/0.8.0-alpha/matter-0.8.0.js) and link it in the html. The online website is http://students.washington.edu/changshu/info343/challenges/matterjs/.**
